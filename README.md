<h2 align="center"><b>About the Project</b></h4>

<p>As I mentioned above this is a building my porfolio webpage project.</p>

<h4><u>User Story</u></h4>

    - As AN employer, I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples, SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

<h4><u>Acceptance Criteria</u></h4>

<p><b>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work</b></p>

    - #1: WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
    - #2: WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
    - #3: WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
    - #4: WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
    - #5: WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
    - #6: WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
