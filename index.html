        <p>
          Daniel Kim can be just one of many Daniel Kims you may find on Facebook when you search his name; however, his dedication to become a full-stack developer, work ethic, and experiences are second to none. He is currently working as a
          software tester in an amazing project and a team. His current interest is building an automated testing tool for the project where his teammates and himself can enhance their productivities.
        </p>

          Daniel’s passion was not coding initially since he did not grow up having a computer handy in his household. His family immigrated to USA in 1998 with an amount of money where a family of three can barely survive two months and the ‘hustle’
          was real. Despite hardship life in America, his parents always placed Daniel’s education first. He ended up joining US Army post college to serve Country that provided so much for him and his family. He proudly served and hung his uniform
          after eight years of active duty military service. Post military, he worked for various companies around northern VA area where he was exposed to computer programming. He always enjoyed being a problem solver and the concept of coding
          grabbed his attention. He took a leap of faith to join GWU coding boot camp in order to achieve his dream of becoming a full-stack developer.
